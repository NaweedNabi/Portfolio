    Our first challenge where we created a webpage from scratch!  Added some styling elements to make the UI compatible on different screen sizes.

    It's a basic portfolio page to showcase the different projects we will work on during the coding bootcamp.

    It has some information about me, a section with my projects, current and pending, as well as contact information.
